write a c program to make a server creates a socket and runs on an infinite loop listening to port 8080 and can send or recieve data only 1024 Byte at a time the server should be able to send and recieve data from a client, if the recieved data contains the string "GET <filename>" the server should send the file to the client sending 1024 Byte at a time until the end of the file and at the end of the file send a "EOF!" string to the client. Similarly on reieving "PUT <filename>" the server should create a file with filename and write the recieving data to the file 1024 Byte at a time until it recieves a "EOF!" string from the clientEOF!
